# odin-recipes
This is the odin reipes project from intro to html.
In this I will have created a basic website containing little to no styling because I will only use html. 
I type using VScode, use the terminal to navigate.
While in the project i will write the html boilerplate, use elaments, links, images and provide sourcres.
